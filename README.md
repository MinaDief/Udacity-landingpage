# Landing Page Project

## Table of Contents

* [Instructions](#instructions)
* [Usability](#usability)

## Instructions
I have added the interactivity for this landing page using Javascript code, also I have added some CSS and HTML code, to match the javascript code.

## Usability
Click on any section on the Nav bar at the top of the web page, and it will scroll you smoothly to the desired section.
Scroll through sections and the background of the current section will be viewed in a special background and animation.


Kindly note that I have made most of the logic on this website, and for few parts,  I have checked some websites to get the right syntax for the code.
those websites are like:
https://stackoverflow.com/
https://www.w3schools.com/
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

Thanks!
